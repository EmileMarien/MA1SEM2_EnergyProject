\label{sec:energy-bill}
The total energy bill for a year is made up of the energy cost, network rates and levies. For the energy cost, two actual Belgian methodologies are compared in this report, being the dual day-night tariff and the dynamic tariff. Each of the components is explained in this section. 

\subsection{dual day-night tariff}
\label{sec:dual-day-night}
The dual day-night tariff is a tariff that is based on the time of the day and day of the week and consists of two parts, being the day- and night tariff. Throughout the working week and from 7:00 to 22:00, the day tariff, with a price of 0.25 \euro/kWh in our case is active. Outside those hours and through the weekend, the night tariff, with a price of 0.15 \euro/kWh in our case is valid. This was historically introduced to stimulate the use of electricity during the night and weekends, when the demand is lower. With the introduction of renewable energy sources, this tariff is controversial, as the production of energy became higher during the day and lower during the night, going into the goal of the tariff.

The energy cost is calculated by multiplying the energy consumption from the grid with the corresponding tariff. This consumption value is the net positive power flow from the grid, meaning that the energy produced by the PV panels and coming from the battery is subtracted from the total consumption.

Next to the variable tariff, a tariff undependent of the night or day is added. 


The network rates and levies are the same for both tariffs. The total energy bill is calculated by summing the energy cost, network rates and levies. 

The day tariff is 0.25 \euro/kWh. The night tariff is active from 22:00 to 7:00 and during the weekend. The night tariff is 0.15 \euro/kWh. The energy cost is calculated by multiplying the energy consumption with the corresponding tariff. The network rates and levies are the same for both tariffs. The total energy bill is calculated by summing the energy cost, network rates and levies.


The energy cost is divided into two parts, being the day and night tariff. The day tariff is higher than the night tariff. The day tariff is active from 7:00 to 22:00, while the night tariff is active from 22:00 to 7:00. The day tariff is 0.25 \euro/kWh, while the night tariff is 0.15 \euro/kWh. The energy cost is calculated by multiplying the energy consumption with the corresponding tariff. The network rates and levies are the same for both tariffs. The total energy bill is calculated by summing the energy cost, network rates and levies.
